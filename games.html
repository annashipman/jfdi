<p>I like to write games in my spare time. Here are some of them.</p>


<div class="left-2-column">

<h3>Snake</h3>
<p>My version of the Nokia phone game. Purely for experimental purposes. This is version 1.0 - playable, but not perfect; comments and suggestions are welcome.
Download the <a href="games/Snake.zip">source code</a> as a zip.
<h3>Bacteria Warfare!</h3>
<p>You can <a href="games/bacteriaggj.html">play the submitted version</a> (requires Flash)<br/> or download the <a href="games/BacteriaWarfareSourceCode.7z">source code</a> as a 7zip.
<p>Your job is to stop the bacteria going down the plughole and blocking the sink for as long as possible. Bacteria are (of course!) repelled if you are a different colour: CNTRL changes colour. Or you can lure them away by planting food of their own colour: SPACE</p>
<p>This game was created as part of the <a href="http://www.globalgamejam.org/">Global Game Jam</a> 2010.</p>

<h3>A Serpent's Tale</h3>
<p>Jump and catch the stars or just roll along and see the circle of life rolling along too.</p>
<p><a href="games/serpentstale.html">Play the submitted version</a> (requires Unity WebPlayer) or <a href="games/WebPlayer.html">this</a> or more info and source code for download <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2012/serpents-tale-0">here</a>.</p>
<p>Created for <a href="http://www.globalgamejam.org/">Global Game Jam</a> 2012.</p>
<h3>Tetris</h3>
<p>This is WIP. I am exploring developing a game using TDD. It's completely unplayable at the moment but the tests all pass!</p>
<p>Download the <a href="games/Tetris.zip">source code</a> as a zip.</p>
<h3>Others...</h3>
<p>For Flock's Sake, where your job is to herd the birds into the holding pen using their natural flocking behaviour is available for download <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2011/flocks-sake">here</a>.</p>
