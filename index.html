    <h2 class="blog-header">How to Estimate</h2>
<em>21st January 2013</em>
<p>I want to share this great idea about estimating that came from the excellent <a href="https://twitter.com/mnowster" target="_blank">Mazz Mosley</a>. Instead of worrying about estimating in hours or days, estimate in story points as follows:</p>

    <h2 class="blog-header">Learning the perls</h2>
<em>20th November 2012</em>
<p>After some time muddling through with Perl, I have accepted the inevitable - it's time to actually knuckle down and learn it properly. I have acquired <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Learning-Perl-Randal-L-Schwartz/dp/1449303587/" target="_blank">some</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Modern-Perl-chromatic/dp/0977920178/" target="_blank">books</a>, but I also require some direction - so I asked my excellent colleague and friend <a href="https://twitter.com/cackhanded" target="_blank">Mark Norman Francis</a> to write a brief guest post for my blog.</p>

<em>19th July 2012</em>
<p>I had a really inspiring chat with <a href="https://twitter.com/mattb" target="_blank">Matt Biddulph</a> about D3 this week. He showed me some really cool things. I made some notes.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-header">CAP again - or should that be PACELC?</h2>
<em>15th July 2012</em>
<p>The last thing I wrote about was the CAP Theorem. Last week, <a href="https://twitter.com/thattommyhall" target="_blank">Tom Hall<a> visited our office and gave a very interesting talk, the central thesis of which was that the CAP Theorem, as often explained, is incorrect - or at least not very meaningful.</p>

    <h2 class="blog-header">The CAP Theorem and MongoDB</h2>
<em>29th April 2012</em>
<p>This week I learned some things about MongoDB. One of them was about how it fits in with the CAP theorem.</p>
<p>They say a picture is worth a thousand words, and I think this diagram from my excellent new colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/matwall" target="_blank">Mat Wall</a> while he was explaining it to me says everything:</p>
